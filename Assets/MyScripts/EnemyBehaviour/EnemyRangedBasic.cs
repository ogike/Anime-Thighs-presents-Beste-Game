/* Shoots the given projectilePrefab-s at the player
 * Can be used as a template for other ranged enemy attack behaviour
 * Uses the EnemyHandler to get the direction/distance to the player
 *      Needs to be on the same GameObject with this
 * The direction to shoot in is handled as a rotation angle (the z value in the editor)
 *      Can be really easy to expand by adding/subtraction values from it, like addig:
 *          spread
 *          multi-directional shooting (either shotguns, or going around in a 360 angle)
 *          etc etc
